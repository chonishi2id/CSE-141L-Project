## **Component 1:** Changelog

* * *
## **Component 2:** ALU operations
[comment]: #List ALU operations you will be demonstrating, including instructions they are relevant to. Also, a brief description of register file functionality is needed
* * *
## **Component 3:** Verilog Models
[comment]: #Provide full verilog models, hierarchically organized if your top level module contains subassembly modules, some of which contain smaller modules
* * * 
## **Component 4:** Timing Diagrams
[comment]: #Provide well-annotated timing diagrams or transcript listings from your module level Questa/ModelSim runs. It should be clear that your program counter / 
instruction memory (fetch unit) and ALU works. If your presentation leaves doubt, we’ll 
assume it doesn’t. 
* * *
## **Component 5:** Answering the Question
[comment]: #Will your ALU be used for non-arithmetic instructions (e.g., MIPS or ARM-like memory address pointer calculations, PC relative branch computations, etc.)? If so, how does that complicate your design?
